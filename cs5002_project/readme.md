# Project Overview 
This repository contains my final project for CS5002 - Discrete Structures.
The project incorporates a variety of topics from the course including 
sequences, algorithms, and recursion as well as incorporating knowledge I have
gained this semster in my concurrent CS5001 course. 

# Recomended Setting
I recomend not exceeding a size of 15 in the sequence if you want to see the 
entire image on your monitor.

# Attached Image 
fibonacci_outputs.png contains example images from the program loosely arranged
in fibonacci like spiral sequence.  The images were generated individually and
compiled using a PowerPoint presentation.

# Requirements 
The fibonacci.py file can be run on any computer with a Python3 interpretor.
